        - Embedded the link to my GitHub repository within an anchor element.

        - Embedded a screenshot from my portfolio website being currently built within an **img** element.

        - Added a class attribute (class="project_thumbnails") to the img element to be used in the style.css file for future styling.

        - Added **figure** and **figcaption** elements. 

    + in the **style.css** file: styled the screenshot using the class="project_thumbnails" attribute. 

* Created and added a new file called **thumbnails** within the **assets** file. This new file will host the screenshots I will take from my project. 

* Learnt how to write professional commit messages for GitHub.

## Challenges I Faced

* Looking out and finding solutions to my questions with the help of various sources and tools: Google, documentations, Codecademy course, Chat GPT... 

* Understanding some of CSS properties to style the screenshot and make it appear as a thumbnail.

## Tools and Technologies I Used

## Remark on today's learning

I have learned so many things today. Often small things, but I feel they are very important additions to my learning. I'm still experiencing much difficulties in using Git Bash and Visual Studio Code to stage and commit to GitHub. Learning how to ammend commit messages took me quite a lot of time, for example.
